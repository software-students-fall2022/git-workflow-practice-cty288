> “Based on our findings, two out of three development teams are literally wasting time on the 97% of fixes that are not attackable and provide little security benefit.”

I found this article particularly interesting as it points out that as more and more developers start focusing on application security and use technology to improve their software's resistance to attacks, exploitable vulnerabilities are becoming fewer and fewer. But =in the process of fixing, most of these vulnerabilities are not easily attacked, causing them to waste too much time in solving these vulnerabilities, thus reducing productivity

Jenny Shen: This article and the points that you made are interesting considering the rapidly growing cybersecurity space (it seems like new firms are increasingly joining the market, and people are pursuing jobs in the field). The article gives perspective that developers may need to take a step back and reasses time management and priorities while also keeping in mind the risks pertaining to weak cybersecurity.
