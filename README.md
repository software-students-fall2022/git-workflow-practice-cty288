I found this article particularly interesting as it points out that ****as more and more developers start focusing on application security and use technology to improve their software's resistance to attacks, exploitable vulnerabilities are becoming fewer and fewer. But =in the process of fixing, most of these vulnerabilities are not easily attacked, causing them to waste too much time in solving these vulnerabilities, thus reducing productivity
