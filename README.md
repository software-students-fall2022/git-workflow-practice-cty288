I found this article particularly interesting as it points out that as more and more developers start focusing on application security and use technology to improve their software's resistance to attacks, exploitable vulnerabilities are becoming fewer and fewer. But =in the process of fixing, most of these vulnerabilities are not easily attacked, causing them to waste too much time in solving these vulnerabilities, thus reducing productivity
